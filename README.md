# MyReads Project

A bookshelf application that allows users to track what books they want to read, they are reading and what books they have read.

## Getting Started

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Usage

Books are organised into three shelves:
- User can change the state of a book by selecting the appropriate shelf from the dowpdown.
- User can search for new books by licking the + link at the bottom right of the screen and then by typing into the search bar.
-- User can then add this book to a shelf.
